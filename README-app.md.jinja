# @{{ app_name }}

@{{ app_name }} is deployed in the following environments:
{% for e in matrix_envs %}
- @{{ e["name"] }} -> @{{ e["app_subdomain"] }}.@{{ e["zone_name"] }}
{%- endfor %}

## Folder structure

- Application source code is stored in the [`application/`](./application/) folder
- Terraform code to perform deployments is stored in the [`deploy/`](./deploy/) folder. 
    - [`deploy/infrastructure/`](./deploy/infrastructure/) for ECR and IAM role (and possible app-related infrastructure). 
    - [`deploy/application/`](./deploy/application/) for Helm release that will deploy new versions of your application.

## Deployment

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to deploy the application and infrastructure. 

The workflow is defined in [`.github/workflows/application.yaml`](.github/workflows/application.yaml) which uses a reusable workflow that is loaded from `https://github.com/tx-pts-dai/github-workflows`.

All the environments are deployed sequentially when pushing to the main branch. Please modify the workflows following examples like [ai-tools](https://github.com/DND-IT/discovery-ai-tools) or [fuw-factsheets](https://github.com/DND-IT/fuw-factsheets).

## Testing

### Infrastructure

Testing infrastructure changes is performed on each feature branch.

### Application

Manual deployment to staging environments can be performed in Github through "Actions" -> "Application" -> "Run workflow" button. Example [ai-tools](https://github.com/DND-IT/discovery-ai-tools/actions/workflows/application.yaml)
